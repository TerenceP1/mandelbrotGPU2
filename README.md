# mandelbrotGPU

This code is a work in progress designed that is intended to run on Windows but is not Windows native. This program is designed to run on a GPU. The majority of the code is CUDA device code. This program (once complete) can generate a smooth zoom animation of the Mandelbrot Set. (

**Note:** CUDA can only run on a NIVIDIA GPU. If you see the program say, "do you have a CUDA capable GPU," use the ZLUDA version (distributable versions are not ready yet

**Note:** More information will be available as I continue to work on this program. This could take a few weeks. It is still inconclusive.

## What is the Mandelbrot Set

**Note: Work on this section later**

The Mandelbrot Set was discovered by Benoit Mandelbrot. Each pixel is a complex number.
